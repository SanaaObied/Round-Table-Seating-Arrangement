                                                    Overview: Round Table Seating Arrangement Problem
In this problem, a group of individuals must be seated around a round table to minimize conflict based on a provided matrix of dislike percentages between each pair. The goal is to find the optimal seating arrangement using Uniform Cost Search (UCS), Greedy Search, and A* Search algorithms.

The problem incorporates a Non-Linear Dislike Cost function, which penalizes high levels of conflict between neighbors more heavily. The search algorithms must ensure that each individual is seated next to those with whom they have the least amount of discomfort, forming a circular arrangement where the first and last individuals are also neighbors.

This problem explores optimization techniques, heuristic evaluation, and cost functions, and the objective is to compare the performance of the algorithms in minimizing overall conflict. The findings will highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
